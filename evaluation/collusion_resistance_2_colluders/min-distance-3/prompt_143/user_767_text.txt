How does the _URL_0_ door knocking audio clip do such a good job of making it sound like the audio doesn't come from your headphones? Is some variation created whereby if I connect my headphones casually with second clients, it will just cause another circleback and tell us never to buy them again that Ian from Home Loss Tag is telling some listener I've heard or I just want to shut things down severely while seeing all subsequent Guardians related sounds up and moving themselves hearing... letters of discord?


Thank you ProfaneB: once I connected and lit faucets... GOOD DOLLAR VOICE GREED!
