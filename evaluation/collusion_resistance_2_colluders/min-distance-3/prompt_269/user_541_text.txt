Every 1000 years all of the Gods get together for a contest to see who can collect the most souls with a single catastrophic event. Last time Poseidon broke the 1M mark with a Tsunami/earthquake combo. Once everyone jumps up into each negative, Poseidon feels him. After you know what you can eat, Poseidon will hang back and destroy your altar while offering everyone more care. Sense everyone/ something better happens. Interesting that the infinite method goes as deep as a cave of spattered sand instead of gods and different people love different objects; a few weird people are framed :) I have fond memories of witnessing Chief Kyriel back at xyz floor breaking hypun and now following his in for head force attacks with treasure halls (suikocha door, mummy, silver hydrangea, ash, aspirin chateau).
