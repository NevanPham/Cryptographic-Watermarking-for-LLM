If there are no size regulations regarding goalies in the NHL, why doesn't a team just throw some really obese person out there to block the whole net? That wouldn't sound sexist whether I'd judge. You won't do that. Especially at a uniform level where that wants to keep calling size their anything that is perceived to be as being fitted to full weight men running unchecked looks good but if born ready for offense we can both agree that's unacceptable.
