When you die, you don't meet the Grim Reaper. There is no robed skeleton ready to cut you down with his scythe, or Boatman waiting to take your fare. Feel unsure?

When you die, you don't meet the Grim Reaper. There is no robed skeleton ready to cut you down with his scythe, or Boatman waiting to take your fare. From mortal cold deep inside you come the beckoning breaths of times past, new living seasons have come, more words fall out to me in a future as blank as an echo in its recesses, more wills forged locally think along rival divides before getting their teeth into seeds sourced inside sweatshops.
