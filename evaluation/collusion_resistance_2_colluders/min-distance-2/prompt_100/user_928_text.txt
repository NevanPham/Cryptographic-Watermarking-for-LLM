When a new library is built, where do they get their books? I understand many can be bought brand new from publishers. But, what about the old books, or the vast volumes of dated encyclopedias, dated periodicals, etc... When such treasures for decades stop going online now, don't mention the wives spoiling provisions when buying repousse from authors generally? More problematic than new language, can a public school miss the opportunity to reformize all sorts of academic practice in libraries
