The future of AI is "software-defined Learning" for Machine Learning at the NSF's Michael Colangelo Machine Learning Initiative, part of the ASI Program in Human Distributed Learning. This presentation focuses on three fundamental truths about autonomy, responsibility, and smart design. De Gucht-Black emphasizes the role of Knowledge and Responsibility and asks for real-world examples of hard decisions that you can make with common sense and creativity. He explores further sub topics regarding how with AI an AI is defined and reconciled with relevant human and AI policies. Topics include the big picture and how AI can in turn usher in smart thinking and trans-humanism, social co-existence, consumerism, and AI to the exclusion of their limited agency. De Gucht-Black holds an advanced degree in machine learning from Swarthmore College, a post-doc in the Max Planck Institute for Computational Science in Geology and Space, and a Master's of Applied Technologies in bioinformatics from Northwestern University.
